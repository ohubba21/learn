         Where We're Going
       </h2>
       <p>
        Few Good Men Tech was created to allow the ordinary individual <br>
        become proficient at technology. The ultimate goal is to show <br>
        technology is our aid rather than our advesary. If you use technology <br>
        but are afraid of it in the same light because of lack of understanding <br>
        this is the place for you.
